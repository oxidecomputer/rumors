The mux campaign's statement of record: what the suite claims, in one
file, audit-small — the Mux/ companion of the base artifact's
Statement.lean, on the same contract. Every theorem below RESTATES a
statement of record inline, fully quantified, and proves it by citing
the landed theorem: the kernel checks that this file's spelling IS the
claim, so any drift between the audit surface and the proofs fails the
build. All on the three standard axioms (`propext`, `Classical.choice`,
`Quot.sound`); no `sorry`, no `native_decide`.

# The resolved trichotomy (MUX-PROGRESS.md §1, the charter)

The campaign's question: does the single-pipe transport NEED
flow-control credits or true channel independence, or does a local
send-order schedule of the protocol's existing messages suffice?

- **C1 as chartered: FALSE** (`c1_charter`; the no-locality companion
  `c1_omniscient`). A deterministic, charter-local strategy pair —
  σ*-causal on both sides — is deadlock-free on the whole
  `.impl` + margin-0 class at every capacity C ≥ 1, locality and
  liveness both kernel-proven, no hypothesis. Nothing needs to be
  added to the wire; the right to IDLE, not frame choice, is the
  entire frontier.
- **C1-WC: TRUE** (`wc_impossibility`; K-parking `wc_impossibility_K`).
  One fixed, Rust-realizable skeleton defeats every WORK-CONSERVING
  pair at every capacity — even omniscient WC dies — and K-deep reply
  parking moves the wall without removing it.
- **C2: TRUE at C₀ = 1** (`oracle_deadlock_free`; the conjunction
  `necessity`). The full-skeleton oracle of record is the STATIC send
  projection of the canonical schedule τ — non-adaptive, consulted
  only through the machine's own flush count; the refuted receive
  projection (`static_oracle_jams`) shows the ORDER, not adaptivity
  and not information, is the liveness ingredient. Necessity is
  class-relative: nonlocal information is necessary under
  work-conservation, not for liveness alone.

Every positive "completes" is two kernel facts: stuck-freedom (the
statement) and termination (`mux_terminating`). Every capacity is
denominated in MESSAGES; the byte-soundness caveat of record is
Mux/Basic.lean's module doc (# The byte-denomination caveat) —
impossibilities transfer to bytes unweakened, positives do not.

# What a skeptical reader must read, in full

The statements below quantify over these definitions and nothing else:

- **The harness** (Mux/Basic.lean, ~200 lines of definitions): `MObs`
  and `Strategy` (the observation alphabet — the slot-peek and
  receipts-out rulings live on `MObs` — and the strategy type),
  `MState`/`MAction`/`apply` (hand + pipe(C) + demux slot; wire sends
  only through the strategy-gated `push`), `mstuck`, `MReachable`,
  `MuxDeadlockFree` (strategies fixed, endpoint interleaving
  adversarial; idling is not a move), and the module doc's
  byte-denomination section, which scopes every positive claim here.
- **The base statement surface** (the root Statement.lean):
  `Skel.wellFormed`, the margin-0 hypothesis
  (`∀ sc, dCount sc ≤ capLevel` — the shipping `FAN ≥ kids`
  discipline), `AxMode.impl`, `Model.apply` — the harness wraps the
  base model unchanged.
- **The strategy classes**: `WorkConserving` (Mux/Strategy.lean,
  ~10 lines: never decline while holding a pushable frame) with its
  K/E-universe twins (`KWorkConserving`, `EWorkConserving`), and
  `CharterLocal` (Mux/Causal.lean: invariance across skeletons with
  equal ANNOUNCED views at `.impl`-realizable observations — the F3
  grain). Auditing `CharterLocal` means auditing the announced view
  itself: `AView`, `announcedIds`, `aviewOf` (Mux/Causal.lean,
  ~60 lines — the positional B5 decode of what arrived frames have
  determined). That is the honest cost of the charter-grain claim;
  Mux/Proofs/Grains.lean pins the grain nondegenerate
  (`charterView_nondegenerate`) and discriminating
  (`oracle_not_charterLocal`).
- **The witnesses' shapes**: the `wedge` literal (Mux/Instances.lean,
  12 scopes) and the `wedgeW` family plus `deliverStepK`/`applyK`
  (Proofs/WcImpossibilityK.lean, ~40 lines) for the K statement.
- The legacy grain (`LocalEq`/`LocalStrategy`, Mux/Strategy.lean) only
  when reading the internal-artifact statements: the grain of record
  is `CharterLocal`, and the two are INCOMPARABLE (Proofs/C1.lean's
  module doc, kernel-pinned in Mux/Proofs/Grains.lean).

The reader need NOT read: anything under `Mux/Proofs/` (proof
scaffolding — its map is Mux/Proofs/Map.lean); the strategy
DEFINITIONS `sigmaStar`, `sigmaStarCausal`, `oracle` (each appears
below only as a witness whose load-bearing properties — locality,
liveness, nonlocality — are themselves kernel theorems; read
Mux/Causal.lean to learn WHAT the schedule computes, not to trust
these claims); the announced trace-family layouts (consumed only by
the witnesses' proofs).

# The chain to the Rust implementation

- **The wedge is real**: `src/tree/mirror/streaming/tests/wedge.rs`
  pins a deterministic tree pair whose trace-decoded skeleton equals
  the `wedge` literal at rootH 6 and matches the generator at the
  protocol's real height 32; the committed proptest seeds realize the
  jam MECHANISM on the old transport (not the byte-exact shape).
- **The announced view is real**: bridge B5 (stage-2 track D)
  reconstructs the announced skeleton from a payload-erased frame
  transcript — the premise behind `aviewOf`'s positional decode.
- **The model runs**: `lake exe muxprobe` executes the same
  `Mux.apply`/`mterminal` these statements quantify over across the
  golden strategy × skeleton × capacity × interleaving matrix
  (byte-pinned; `just muxprobe`), and Mux/Proofs/Twins.lean pins the
  executable twins definitionally equal to the kernel objects.
- **Height gap, honestly**: the executable tier tops at rootH 8 and
  the kernel literals at rootH 6, against the protocol's 32; the
  height-transfer argument (the jam mechanism is height-independent)
  is [derived], with wedge.rs pinning both ends.

# Assumed, not proven

- **Byte denomination**: positive statements say less than their
  byte-level reading; the W = 1 structural argument is assumed at the
  model boundary (Mux/Basic.lean, # The byte-denomination caveat).
- **`KR ≥ 4`** in `wc_impossibility_K` is [derived] (the
  widened-family argument); the kernel anchors are KR ∈ {1, 2, 3}.
- **The `.full`/schedulable port** is open by ruling: every mux
  statement of record lives at `.impl` + margin-0.
- **Internal artifacts stay conditional forever**: `c1_literal_false`
  (Proofs/C1.lean) carries the omniscient σ*'s legacy-grain locality
  as named [open] hypotheses — superseded as a claim of record by
  `c1_charter` below, retained as the stage-3 record.
- The base model's premises (error-free conforming peers, SPSC
  channels, per-channel in-order delivery): the root Statement.lean.

# Conservativity notes

- `mcanStep` enumerates `allMActions`; an accidental omission makes
  `mstuck` easier and every positive `MuxDeadlockFree` claim HARDER to
  prove, so the enumeration cannot silently weaken one. For the
  impossibilities the concern inverts, and their stuck certificates
  are kernel-replayed on concrete runs — nothing is enumerated away.
- `mterminal` (base terminal + both pipes drained) is the definition
  that could weaken a claim by holding too early: the F8-strengthened
  wire closes police exactly that, and the gadget controls
  (`Control.noF8_bogus_terminal`, `Control.noF8_bogus_mterminal`,
  `Control.f8_rejects_gadgetTrap`, Mux/Controls.lean) pin the guard
  live from both sides.

# Non-vacuity

Every ∀-class statement cites a kernel inhabitant and every witness
skeleton its class membership: `wedge_wellFormed` + `wedge_margin0`
(the impossibility witness sits inside the base flagship's proven
class, so a muxed jam indicts the mux alone);
`bottomMostReady_wc`/`_wcK`/`_wcE` + `bottomMostReady_local`
(Mux/Proofs/Inhabitation.lean: the shipped policy inhabits every
indicted class); `localEq_nondegenerate` and
`charterView_nondegenerate` (both locality grains are nondegenerate);
`mreachable_init` below (the reachability quantifiers are inhabited);
and the completion pins (`smokeChain_mux_completes`,
`wedge_sigmaStarCausal_completes`, `piWedge_oracle_completes`, …) run
each positive witness end to end in the kernel.

/-- C1 as chartered is FALSE — the campaign's headline (MUX-PROGRESS
§1's first trichotomy bullet, at the grain of record per Finch's F3
ruling): it is NOT the case that every charter-local deterministic
pair has a killer skeleton. The refutation witness is
⟨C = 1, σ*-causal, σ*-causal⟩ with locality
(`sigmaStarCausal_charterLocal`) and liveness
(`sigmaStarCausal_deadlock_free`) both kernel-proven — no hypothesis.
The class hypothesis has bite: `charterView_nondegenerate` pins the
grain nondegenerate and `oracle_not_charterLocal` pins a strategy
outside it (Mux/Proofs/Grains.lean). Rests on message-denominated
liveness; the byte caveat of record is Mux/Basic.lean's module doc

/-- C1-WC is TRUE (T3; §1's second trichotomy bullet): one fixed
skeleton — `wedge`, the committed-regression shape, inside the base
flagship's proven class (`wedge_wellFormed`, `wedge_margin0`) —
defeats every work-conserving pair at every capacity, locality not
even assumed. Each hypothesis is pinned load-bearing:
work-conservation by `Control.wedge_idler_completes` (an idling pair
completes the same skeleton), the one-slot demux by
`Control.wedge_unboundedSlot_completes`, `1 ≤ C` by
`Control.smokeChain_C0_not_deadlockFree`; the class is
kernel-inhabited (`bottomMostReady_wc`), so the ∀ is not

wedge defeats every work-conserving pair. `KR ≥ 4` is [derived] (the
widened-family argument — each depth needs its own kernel replay); the
witnesses are inside the base flagship's class (`wedgeW_wellFormed`,
`wedgeW_margin0`); the class is kernel-inhabited
(`bottomMostReady_wcK`). Message-denominated; transfers to bytes

session at every capacity C ≥ 1 ("completes" = this stuck-freedom plus
`mux_terminating` below). This is the charter's constructive witness:
demand-lockstep over the ANNOUNCED sub-skeleton — the announcement
prefix the protocol already carries, FIFO positional arithmetic, and
the inevitability closure; nothing new on the wire (the "mysterious
third thing", named). The evidence-only control

# T8 SECTION STUB — deliberately unfilled; the T8 track fills it

T8 (`sigmaStarK_deadlock_free`, the window-generalized positive half)
has its English statement fixed BEFORE its build: formal/T8-SPEC.md is
the specification of record, and the restatement that lands here must
transcribe its clauses —

1. **domain**: every well-formed margin-0 skeleton, `.impl` — the base
   flagship's own class, no new tree assumptions;
2. **capacity**: every C ≥ 1, universally quantified;
3. **windows**: every advertised depth pair K_I ≥ 1, K_R ≥ 1,
   independent and possibly unequal (a single-K statement is WEAKER
   and fails the audit);
4. **order**: every selection rule among licensed frames — the
   statement quantifies over a licensed-push strategy CLASS with the
   canonical scheduler and the shipped priority ladder as pinned
   instances (a concrete-scheduler-only statement is WEAKER and fails
   the audit);
5. **licensing**: the causal closure over the announced sub-skeleton
   at parking arrears K, charter-local in the F3 sense
   (`causalStuckCoverage`, Proofs/CausalMint.lean, is this clause's
   inference-progress conjunct at K = 1; an omniscient-closure
   statement is WEAKER and fails the audit);
6. **completes**: progress AND termination — the K-variant run bound
   (`mrho_decreasesK` exists; its run-level consumer lands with T8; a
   progress-only statement is WEAKER and fails the audit).

The impossibility half is landed and restated above
(`wc_impossibility_K`). At the T8 merge this stub is replaced by the
restatements and the merge-seam checklist runs over the seam
(MUX-PROGRESS §1's discipline note).
