σ*-causal: the charter-grain local demand-lockstep strategy — the Lean
twin of the stage-0 probe's faulting view (causal-reference.py, the
AUTHORITATIVE reference), discharging the definitional half of the
σ*-locality residue (MUX-PROGRESS §4, "The locality residue adjudicated
by Finch"; F3 ruling: claims of record bind the charter grain).

# The grain (Finch's F3 ruling, phase 4)

The legacy `LocalEq`/`LocalStrategy` (Mux/Strategy.lean) compares
session-start VIEWS — but `viewEnc` encodes peer-determined merge
labels (D vs R-cut vs M-absent) of the party's own held children, which
no party knows at session start from its own tree. The charter's honest
grain is *information in the causal past of the party at the decision
point*: in this model, the session parameters plus the sub-skeleton
ANNOUNCED by the frames that have arrived (refute-c1 §1.2's two minting
rules; bridge axiom B5: frames are decoded at delivery, so an arrived
frame's decoded record is trace information even though the
payload-erased `MObs` does not carry it syntactically). `aviewOf` below
is exactly that announced view — the probe's `KnownSkel`, whose t = 0
state is the bare parameters. `CharterLocal` (invariance across equal
announced views at `.impl`-consistent observations) is the locality
class of record; note it is INCOMPARABLE to the legacy class, not
finer: `LocalEq` pairs may differ in announced content (answerer-side
R children, `leafReqs` of announced scopes), and announced-view pairs
may differ in unannounced view structure. The a-fortiori transfer
between the two classes therefore fails in both directions — recorded
here so nobody re-derives it hopefully (Proofs/C1.lean carries the
statement-of-record consequences).

# Why the strategy reads `sk` where it does

Every `sk`-read in `aviewOf` is announced-gated: positional decode of
an arrival to the scope it is about (B5 rule 1), the record of an
announced scope, and the kid labels a known record's frame carried
(B5 rule 2 — Python's `kinds[kd]` stratum). Everything downstream —
census, layouts, closure, demand — is a pure function of the `AView`
tuple, so `sigmaStarCausal_charterLocal` is a computation, not an
inference-sufficiency theorem. A payload-erased surrogate that pins the
same data from the party's own commit ledger (d4/d6 pacing) plus
arrival counts was designed and rejected for the claim of record: the
alternation parity puts the peer-stage kind marks on the wrong side
forever (they ride only payloads), so an `MObs`-only strategy
under-derives and starves on the wedge's provision wall — the
payload-erasure finding this track reports (MUX-PROGRESS §4 entry).

# The announced trace family and the causal closure

The closure needs only the PEER endpoint's traces: no internal channel
crosses the link, so a peer event's E1/E2/E3 past touches peer events,
wire sends (evidence: `groundedPush`, unchanged — it was always
history-only), and the party's own wire receives (C-own evidence from
its own `.act` stream). The layouts transcribe the `.impl` trace
grammar (`Sched.walkEventsE`/`asmEvents`/`absorbEvents`/openers/fins)
over the partial record table, TRUNCATING at the first unannounced
quantity — Python's `Unknown` discipline in trace form: derive less,
never guess. Announced traces are therefore literal prefixes of the
true traces, which is what the deferred containment lemma wants.

`istepOkA` is `istepOk` with the two skeleton reads rerouted: `capA`
(the `capLevel` parameter — `Skel.cap` reads nothing else) for the
positional slot-E2 window, the announced family for the E3 past. The
F6 membership discipline and the no-cross-stream-pipe-edges shape are
inherited verbatim.

# AxMode binding

Everything here lives at `.impl`: the layouts transcribe the
d6/epilogue trace grammar, `ConsistentImpl` pins the mode, and the
probe evidence (4,970/4,970 terminal causal runs, STAGE0-GATES.md P1)
is `.impl`-only. Under other modes the layouts would be wrong-shaped
and every claim below is simply not made.

# Proof state (honest ledger)

Kernel-proven here: `sigmaStarCausal_charterLocal` (both parties,
definitional), the wf-free `partyOf` pinning it rests on, and the
executable pins (`smokeChain` and — the real derivation exercise —
`wedge`, whose provision wall demands closure-proven frames 2..7 on
the initiator's top stream).

Kernel-proven in Proofs/CausalCoverage.lean, Proofs/CausalLive.lean,
and Proofs/CausalMint.lean (the liveness track, now CLOSED): the
announced-prefix property — every `announcedProcs` trace is a literal
prefix of its true `.impl` process trace (`announcedProcs_prefix`) —
the receive ledger (`RecvLedger`), the causal keystone (`keystoneA`),
σ*-causal's push certificates (`pushProvenA_reachable`), Step 1's
pipes-drain (`sigmaStarCausal_pipes_empty`), the liveness assembly
`sigmaStarCausal_deadlock_free_of_coverage`, AND its one conjunct:
`CausalStuckCoverage`, discharged by `causalStuckCoverage`
(Proofs/CausalMint.lean). The discharge is the minting ladder — at a
stuck drained state every record the closure consults was announced,
because the consulting event's τ-past contains the minting frame's
send and drained pipes make sent frames delivered — composed with the
τ-staged causal coverage induction and the closure's saturation
argument. `sigmaStarCausal_deadlock_free` is therefore unconditional,
`c1_charter_false` carries no hypothesis (Proofs/C1.lean), and T8's
"inference progress" conjunct is available as a lemma.

This is Finch's F3 grain — "information in the causal past of that
party at the decision point": the announced view (`aviewOf`, the
probe's `KnownSkel`) is precisely what the arrived frames have
determined, with the session parameters as its t = 0 state. It is
deliberately NOT the legacy `LocalStrategy` (Mux/Strategy.lean), whose
`viewEnc` grain encodes peer-determined merge labels a party cannot
know at session start; the two classes are incomparable (module doc),
and the claims of record quantify over THIS one (Proofs/C1.lean). -/
