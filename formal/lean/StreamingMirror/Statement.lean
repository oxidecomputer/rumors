The statement of record: what this artifact claims, in definitions small
enough to audit by reading them.

# The audit surface

To believe `DeadlockFree sk AxMode.full` (once proven), a skeptical
reader must read, in full:

- `Skel.wellFormed` (Skel.lean, ~25 lines) — which dispute skeletons the
  claim covers;
- `AxMode` and `AxMode.full` (Skel.lean, 10 lines) — which send-order
  axioms are assumed; the mapping to the Rust `Trace::assert_valid`
  ledgers is the table in formal/README.md;
- `Model.apply` (Model.lean, ~150 lines) — the protocol model itself:
  every guard and every state delta. This is the irreducible core; it is
  trusted not by inspection alone but by cross-pinning (the Phase A
  matrix runs to completion inside Lean: `Pin.positives_complete`), by
  the adversarial transcription review (formal/README.md, Phase C), and
  by the must-fail regression `Pin.phantom_walk_rejected`;
- `Model.Reachable`, `Model.stuck`, `Model.terminal`, `Model.canStep`
  (Model.lean, a few lines each) — reachability is init plus closure
  under `apply`; stuck is "not finished and nobody can move".

The reader need NOT read: `Model.Inv` (the inductive invariant) or
anything under `Proofs/` — those are proof scaffolding, absent from the
statement.

# Conservativity notes

- `canStep` enumerates `allActions`. An accidental omission from that
  list makes `stuck` easier to satisfy, so `DeadlockFree` only gets
  HARDER to prove — the enumeration cannot silently weaken the claim.
- `terminal` is the definition that could weaken the claim if it held
  too early. The Phase A pins check conservation (all channels drained)
  at terminal executably; a planned corollary of `inv_reachable` makes
  that a theorem (see formal/README.md, Phase C).

# Non-vacuity

`wellFormed_satisfiable` and `reachable_init` below witness that the
hypotheses of the claim are inhabited: there are well-formed skeletons
(kernel-`decide`d, no native trust), and every skeleton has a reachable
state.

/-- Deadlock-freedom, the Phase C target: under axiom mode `ax`, no
reachable state of the session is stuck — every interleaving either can
still move or has completed. The target instance is `AxMode.full` (the
six-ledger interface), pending the progress lemma. The mode index is
load-bearing, and that is a THEOREM, not a promise:
`Control.jam_not_deadlockFree` refutes this very statement for the
pre-finding-#6 interface (`Control.fullNoD4` — everything but wire
contiguity), by a kernel-checked stuck run on a well-formed skeleton. -/
